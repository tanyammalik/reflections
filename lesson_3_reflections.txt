When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'm sharing the files with others, or when I'd like to invite people to make their own changes to the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You can pull when it makes sense in the project, not just randomly in the middle of a change.
