When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'm sharing the files with others, or when I'd like to invite people to make their own changes to the project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a copy of a repository on GitHub. A clone is a copy of a GitHub repository on your local machine. A branch is an alternate version of a repository either on your local machine or on GitHub.
